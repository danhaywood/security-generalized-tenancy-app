This link:http://isis.apache.org[Apache Isis] application demonstrates how to use the `ApplicationTenancyEvaluator` SPI
service from the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security[Isis addons' security] module, allowing
a given user to have access to multiple disjoint sets of objects.


== Domain model

The domain model is one of `Concert` objects, where each such concert has a corresponding committee to organize said
concert.  The members of the committee can be added and removed at runtime or defined when creating a new `Concert`
object.

A user can be assigned to be a member of multiple committees, and can only the members of a concert's organization
committee should be able to view/modify the `Concert`.

[NOTE]
====
This example was motivated by
link:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/6350239823b8098e9cfaf4cb5273c8a7f3bae62cf1eef7b5e59b8f25@%3Cusers.isis.apache.org%3E[this question]
on the Apache Isis mailing list.
====


This demo app models the concept of an committee of a `Concert` as a security role, and the security role and the
`Concert` are linked simply by the name of each.  Thus, having the "easter2017" security role granted means
that the user can view/edit the corresponding `Concert` object named "easter2017".

== Implementation

The implementation relies on this implementation of `ApplicationTenancyEvaluator`:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class ApplicationTenancyEvaluatorForConcerts implements ApplicationTenancyEvaluator {
    public boolean handles(Class<?> cls) {
        return Concert.class.isAssignableFrom(cls);
    }
    public String hides(Object domainObject, ApplicationUser applicationUser) {
        if (!(domainObject instanceof Concert)) {
            return null;
        }
        final Concert concert = (Concert) domainObject;

        final Optional<ApplicationRole> roleIfAny =
                applicationUser.getRoles()
                        .stream()
                        .filter(role -> Objects.equals(role.getName(), concert.getName()))  // <1>
                        .findAny();

        return roleIfAny.isPresent()? null: "Requires role " + concert.getName();
    }
    public String disables(Object domainObject, ApplicationUser applicationUser) {
        return null;
    }
}
----
<1> this is the important line, correlating the name of the `ApplicationRole` with the name of the `Concert`



== How to run the Demo App

The prerequisite software is:

* Java JDK 8 (&gt;= 1.9.0) or Java JDK 7 (&lt;= 1.8.0)
** note that the compile source and target remains at JDK 7
* http://maven.apache.org[maven 3] (3.2.x is recommended).

To build the demo app:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/danhaywood/security-generalized-tenancy-app.git .
mvn clean install
----

To run the demo app:

[source,bash]
----
cd webapp
mvn jetty:run
----


You can log in with:

* `bill` / `pass` - has access to the "easter2017" and "christmas2017" ``Concert``s
* `joe` / `pass` - has access to the "easter2017" and "summer2017" ``Concert``s
* `isis-module-security-admin` / `pass` - security administrator, can be used to grant/revoke roles
